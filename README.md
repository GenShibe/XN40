<h1>"Why is it called XN40?" - no one</h1>
<p>The reason it's called XN40 is because all my devices are named under a specific theme, that theme being North American bus models. Do not question why, as it should be bloody obvious :3</p>

<h1> How to Install </h1>
you don't (yet...)  the option to install may come later (but likely won't), but it really depends on how shit i feel my dots are (they're very shit, do not use)

<h2> Credits </h2>
i'd like to thank those who had to suffer from helping me out with NixOS, and for putting up with me being a nixOS noob ðŸ’™
<br>
<br>
in all seriousness and no particular order though, these very very cool and based people helped me figure out the complex system that is NixOS:
